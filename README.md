### MVP/PostMVP - Determine what is neccesary for primary deployment.

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Be a working, interactive, React application. 
- Include data from own API 
- Include React Router with at least 2 routes 
- Have at least 5 separate components, using a readable file structure. 
- Be built using Create React App. 
- Implement responsive design using flexbox, grid, or another css framework. 
- Use React Hooks. 
- Be deployed via Netlify.

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add styling to make the weather application look appealing to the user. ✔
- Add additonal components if time permits. ✔
- Add Javascript animations to the application.

| Footer | Contains footer text with creator.|


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Initializing framework/app | H | 30mins| 20mins | 20mins |
| Testing API | H | 20mins| 20mins | 20mins |
| Building Components | H | 6hrs| 4.5hrs | 4.5hrs |
| API component | H | 5hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Rendering data pull from API | H | 5hrs| 4hrs | 4hrs |
| CSS Styling | M | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
| Double-checking State | H | 5hrs| 3hrs | 3hrs |
| Total | H | 27.5hrs| 21hrs | 21hrs |


## Additional Libraries
I will probably use the following libraries and frameworks:

- React
- React Router
- SASS/SCSS
- Bootstrap
