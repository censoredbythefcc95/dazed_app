## API

I will be developing my own API on express.js and deploying it on MongoDB Atlas.


```
const quotes = [
  "name": "Woody Wooderson",
  "quote": "Alright, alright, alright!",
  "location": "Emporium Parking Lot
]

```


### MVP/PostMVP - Determine what is neccesary for primary deployment.

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Be a working, interactive, React application. 
- Include data from own API 
- Include React Router with at least 2 routes 
- Have at least 5 separate components, using a readable file structure. 
- Be built using Create React App. 
- Implement responsive design using flexbox, grid, or another css framework. 
- Use React Hooks. 
- Be deployed via Netlify.

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Framer Motion to give aesthetic to the page.
- Add additonal components if time permits. 
- Add Javascript animations to the application. 

## Components
Initial components decided for Project. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Navbar | This will hold the search bar and other components. | 
| Quotes | Renders all quotes. | 
| Soundtrack | Renders all tracks in the soundtrack. |
| Character | Renders character with all quotes. |
| Footer | Contains footer text with masthead. |


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Initializing framework/app | H | 30mins| |  |
| Testing API | H | 20mins|  |  |
| Building Components | H | 6hrs|  | |
| API component | H | 5hrs|  | |
| Rendering data pull from API | H | 5hrs|  |  |
| CSS Styling | M | 6hrs|  |  |
| Double-checking State | H | 5hrs|  |  |
| Total | H | 27.5hrs|  |  |


## Additional Libraries
I will probably use the following libraries and frameworks:

- React
- React Router
- SASS/SCSS
- Framer Motion
- Netlify Deploy
